# UAVSystemSimProject

This project is designed to simulate a system of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating on an "as a service" basis. 
The results of simulations are produced in *.csv files which can be processed using matlab to produce visualisations. 

In the current form, simulation parameters must be changed by editing the main function of UAVSystemSimProject.cpp

The MatlabVisualisation folder contains several basic scrips to produce graphs using the results generated from simulations run. 
Examples of the graphs produced can be found in the Graphs folder, grouped by differing simulation parameters.
