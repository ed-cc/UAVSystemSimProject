2-200 UAVs
500 tasks 
Tasks generated about positions:
{ -707,707,0 }
{ -707,-707,0 }
{ 707,707,0 }
{ 707,-707,0 }
{ 0,0,0 } <-- This one should have the highest task density
All UAVs based at position { 0,0,0 }
Suggests around 60 UAVs is optimal But fewer could be acceptable
-> 60 would correspond to the same number of UAVs / task as the first set of results
Area covered corresponds to ( 3 * pi - ( pi -2 ) ) = 8.2832 km^2
